    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [

]
# This code sets up the URL routing for the Django project, linking the 'polls' app's URLs to the main project URLs.
# The `include` function allows for modular URL configurations, making it easier to manage URLs in larger projects.
# The `admin` path is included for accessing the Django admin interface.
